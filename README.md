# Overview
Right-click and send images right to Photopea.
If you have an instance of Photopea open, the image will be sent there.

Browse and edit your images, faster.

Should work for Image Elements, and Video Elements too. ;D
(but not yet for those with overlay elements)

Now you can also click on the extension button to send a screenshot to Photopea.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not affiliated with Photopea, just a big fan of it. :D
