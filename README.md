# Send 2 Photopea
Send image to Photopea Chrome Extension

You can find it here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send2photopea/ngjdphpkaopdenfbgkkkgmajgcmhpkme

# Overview
Right-click and send images right to Photopea.
If you have an instance of Photopea open, the image will be sent there.

Browse and edit your images, faster.

Should work for Image Elements, and Video Elements too. ;D
(but not yet for those with overlay elements)

Now you can also right-click on the extension button and choose "Take page screenshot..." to send a screenshot to Photopea.

... and choose to open Photopea in incognito if it's not already open (tick "Use incognito..." from the extension button context menu).

TIP: to take screenshots of YouTube videos right-click twice on the video to get past the custom context menu and to the native one that will show a "Send to Photopea" entry ;)

[CHROME]
I frequently use this extension in combination with my other extension (WebClip Element) to clip elements on a page and then send them to Photopea.

[FIREFOX]
BE SURE TO GIVE THE NECESSARY PERMISSIONS AFTER INSTALLATION:
To make the extension work properly you need to give it the permission to "Access your data for all websites" (it's needed to fetch image data and properly send it to Photopea).
Follow this quick tutorial if you don't know how to do it: https://github.com/azrafe7/send2photopea/issues/2.

Don't worry, no data handled by the extension ever leaves your computer.
