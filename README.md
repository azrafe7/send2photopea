# Overview
Right-click and send images right to Photopea.
If you have an instance of Photopea open, the image will be sent there.

Browse and edit your images, faster.

Should work for Image Elements, and Video Elements too. ;D
(but not yet for those with overlay elements)

Now you can also click on the extension button to send a screenshot to Photopea.

[CHROME]
I frequently use this extension in combination with my other extension (WebClipElement) to clip elements on a page and then send them to Photopea.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not affiliated with Photopea, just a big fan of it. :D


[FIREFOX]
INSTALL/THROUBLESHOOTING: Note that to make it work you need to give the extension the permission to "Access your data for all websites" (it's needed to fetch image data and properly send it to Photopea).
To do so, right-click on the extension icon once installed, and click on "Manage Extension", then enabled "Access your data for all websites".

Don't worry, no data handled by the extension ever leaves your computer.
